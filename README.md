Domain Ontology for Additive Manufacturing (DOAM)
=================================================
DOAM is an ontologisation of [ISO/ASTM 52900] which provides a
standard for the general principles, fundamentals and a vocabulary for
additive manufacturing.

DOAM consist of two modules:
* [astm52900]: A direct ontologisation of [ISO/ASTM 52900] with no top-level
  ontology.
* [doam]: A **domain ontology for additive manufacturing** that connects
  [astm52900] to the [EMMO] top-level ontology and thereby provides
  strong ontological commitments and interoperability with other EMMO-based
  domain ontologies.
